<div style="line-height: 2;"><span class="ml-2em">Homelessness</span> is a big problem that affects people and communities everywhere. To understand it better, we need to look at <span style="text-decoration:underline">why it happens and what it does</span> to people and our society. It is important to understand <span style="text-decoration:underline">the reasons for</span> homelessness and <span style="text-decoration:underline">what happens</span> when people don't have a home.<br/>

That is often too much for one person to pay. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Finally,</span> homelessness <b>is caused by</b> mental health issues and substance abuse problems. If someone has a mental health problem or addiction to drugs or alcohol, it can be difficult to sustain a home or job or to build support networks, and this also <b>leads to</b> homelessness.<br/>

Homeless people often suffer from physical and mental health challenges, reduced access to education, an limited job opportunities. It is hard for homeless people to break this cycle and start a new life. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Second,</span> not having stable housing can also make homeless individuals more vulnerable to illness or violence. <span style="text-decoration:underline">For instance,</span> people who are homeless get sick more often <b>because</b> they don't have a safe place to stay. Being homeless can also be dangerous, especially for women and children who might be hurt or taken advantage of. Furthermore, seeing homelessness in public places can create a negative image of a city or community. This <b>results in</b> losses in tourism and local.<br/>
