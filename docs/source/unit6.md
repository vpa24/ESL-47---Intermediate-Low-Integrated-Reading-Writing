## Relative Clauses (Adjecive Clauses)

````{admonition} MAKING PREDICTIONS
:class: important

Use relative clauses to give more information about a noun without starting a new sentence. There are **two kinds of relative clauses: identifying and nonidentifying**. **Identifying clauses give essential information** about the identity of the noun they modify. They are not separated from the rest of the sentence with commas. In contrast, **nonidentifying relative clauses have commas before and sometimes after them. They give extra, nonessential information** about the noun. These clauses can be removed from the sentence, but the identity of the noun will still be clear.

```{raw} html
<table>
	<tr colspan="2">
		<th>indentify clauses</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>start with <i>who for people</i> or <i>that for people or things</i></td>
		<td>Velcro® has a unique <b>structure</b>. It allows two strips to stick together. -> Velcro® has a unique structure <b>that</b> <u>allows two strips to stick together.</u></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<table>
	<tr colspan="2">
		<th>nonindentify clauses</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>start with *who for people* and *which for things*</td>
		<td>Velcro® was invented in 1941 by George de Mestral. <b>George de Mestral</b> saw the seeds on his dog's hair. -> Velcro® was invented in 1941 by George de Mestral<b>, who</b> <u>saw the seeds on his dog's hair.</u></td>

## Writing An Introductory Paragraph

````{admonition} WRITING AN INTRODUCTORY PARAGRAPH
:class: important

```{raw} html
<p>The first, or introductory, paragraph of an essay usually has three parts:</p>
<p>· a hook	· background information	· a thesis statement</p>
<p>The <span style="font-weight:bold">hook</span> is a statement or question at the beginning of the paragraph. Its purpose is to get the reader interested in the topic so he or she will want to keep reading. A good hook can be a thought-provoking question, a surprising fact or statistic, a request to the reader to imagine a situation, an observation, or a quotation.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p class="color-blue">In 2014, Americans spent 6.9 billion hours sitting in rush-hour traffic. Now imagine what we could do with all that time if we did not need to commute.<br/> Many nations are in danger of running out of water. However, an Israeli company has invented a device that turns water vapor from the air into water you can drink.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Background information</span> provides context to help readers understand the essay. Background information can include a definition of terms, historical information, data and statistics, or a general explanation of the topic.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">The thesis statement</span> is usually the last sentence of the introduction. It tells the reader how the essay will be developed. Often a thesis statement has two parts: <u>a topic</u> + <u>a point of view</u>. For example:</p>
<p class="color-blue" style="text-decoration:underline">Flying cars may reduce congestion on the ground, but they may create
additional problems, such as congestion in the air and pollution.</p>

<p>This thesis statement informs the reader that the topic, flying cars, will be followed by both advantages and disadvantages of flying cars.</p>
