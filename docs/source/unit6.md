## Writing An Introductory Paragraph

````{admonition} WRITING AN AAN INTRODUCTIVE PARAGRAPH
:class: important

```{raw} html
The first, or introductory, paragraph of an essay usually has three parts:
· a hook	· background information	· a thesis statement

The <span style="font-weight:bold">hook</span> is a statement or question at the beginning of the paragraph. Its purpose is to get the reader interested in the topic so he or she will want to keep reading. A good hook can be a thought-provoking question, a surprising fact or statistic, a request to the reader to imagine a situation, an observation, or a quotation.
For example:
<div class="color-blue">In 2014, Americans spent 6.9 billion hours sitting in rush-hour traffic. Now imagine what we could do with all that time if we did not need to commute.<br/> Many nations are in danger of running out of water. However, an Israeli company has invented a device that turns water vapor from the air into water you can drink.</div>

<span style="font-weight:bold">Background information</span> provides context to help readers understand the essay. Background information can include a definition of terms, historical information, data and statistics, or a general explanation of the topic.

<span style-"font-weight:bold">The thesis statement</span> is usually the last sentence of the introduction. It tells the reader how the essay will be developed. Often a thesis statement has two parts: a topic and a point of view. For example:
	topic	point of view
<div class="color-bule" style="text-decoration:underline">Flying cars may reduce congestion on the ground, but they may create
additional problems, such as congestion in the air and pollution.</div>

This thesis statement informs the reader that the topic, flying cars, will be followed
by both advantages and disadvantages of flying cars.
