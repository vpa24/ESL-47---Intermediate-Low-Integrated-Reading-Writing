## Comparative Adjectives

When comparing things, the comparative form of the adjective is used. Use the comparative form of an adjective + _than_ to compare two people or things.

<table>
   <tr>
      <th>Rule</th>
      <th>Example</th>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>Add <em>-er</em> to <strong>one-syllable</strong> adjectives. If the adjective ends in <em>-e</em>, just add <em>-r</em>.</td>
      <td>The red squirrel is <strong>smaller than</strong> the gray squirrel.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>Use <em>more/less</em> + <em>adjective</em> + <em>than</em> for adjectives with <strong>two or more syllables</strong>.</td>
      <td>The gray squirrel is <strong>more intelligent than</strong> the red squrirel.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>If an adjective with <strong>two syllables ends in -y</strong>, <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">remove</mark> the *-y* and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">add</mark> *-ier*</td>
      <td>The gray squirrel is <strong>heavier than</strong> the red squirrel.</td>
   </tr>
</table>

## Compare and Contrast

### Compare and contrast using Venn diagram

```{admonition} Using a Venn diagram

A Venn diagram is useful for taking notes on similarities and differences. It consists of two or three overlapping circles. The differences will listed on the left side and right side of the diagram. The similarities are listed in the center.
```

For example, birds and bats are profiled by both their similarities and differences in a single visual.

### Example Paragraphs: 2 Similarities + 2 Differences

<h2 align="center" class="para_title">British and American English</h2>
<div style="line-height: 2;">There are some similarities and some differences between <b>American English and British English</b>. English is a global language spoken and understood by millions of people around the world, and two of the most common variations of English are British English, spoken in the U.K., and American English, spoken in the U.S.  <ins>The first similarity is that <b>both American and British English share the same grammar</b></ins>. Both varieties of English have the same subject-verb agreement rules and sentence structure. <ins>Another similarity <b>is the vocabulary</b></ins>. People can use many of the same basic words and phares in the U.S. or the U.K. and people will understand them. <span style="text-decoration:underline">For example,</span> if you ask someone "Where is the bus stop?" in either the U.K or the U.S., that person will be able to help you. <ins>However, there are also many differences between <b>these two varieties of English.</b></ins> <ins>The first difference is <b>the pronunciation.</b></ins> There are many words and sounds that are pronounced differently in British English and American English. <span style="text-decortaion:underline">For instance,</span> in British English, people don't usually pronounce the "r" sound, but it is pronounced strongly in American English (such as the word "water"). <ins>The second difference is <b>the spelling.</b></ins> American English often drops the "u" in words that are spelled "colour" or "harbour" in British English. (The American spellings of these words are "color" and "harbor"). <ins><span style="text-decoration:underline">In conclusion,</span> there are both similarities and differences <b>in the varieties of the English that are used in the U.S. and the U.K.</b></ins></div>

## Topic sentences

```{admonition} A topic sentence

A <b>topic sentence</b> is <ins>usually the first sentence in a paragraph.</ins> It <ins>introduces the main idea</ins> of the paragraph and often the point that the writer wants to make about the topic. A topic sentence should be a <ins>general</ins> statement about the paragraph's subject, but <ins>it shouldn't be too specific</ins>. It is then support by the order sentences in the paragraph.
```

#### Example

**Bold text is the correct topic sentences for the paragraph**

1. <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>. The cheetah is one of the fastest animals. It can run as fast as cars can drive on the motorway. In contrast to what most people think, big cats are all scared of water. Tigers and jaguars are strong swimmers.
   <ul>
      <li>Jaguars are losing their habitat. </li>
      <li>Humans are major threat to tigers. </li>
      <li class="bold">Big cats are among the world's most amazing creatures.</li>
   </ul>

2. <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>. People hunt them for their skin and bones. They use their body parts to make medicine. Due to these practices, three subspecies of these big cats have become extinct in the past 80 years. Other subspecies are endangered.
   <ul>
      <li>Jaguars are losing their habit.</li>
      <li class="bold">Humans are a major threat to tiger.</li>
      <li>Big cats among the world's most amazing creatures.</li>
   </ul>

3. <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>. These cats live in the rainforest. As the rainforest is destroyed, they lose their hunting ground. These cats have survived for over two million years, but this may change.
   <ul>
      <li class="bold">Jaguars are login their habitat.</li>
      <li>Humans are a major threat to tigers.</li>
      <li>Big cats among the world's most amazing creatures.</li>
   </ul>

## Combing Sentences

### AND and OR

````{admonition} AND and OR
:class: important

When joining two sentences together, you can also take out some words. This makes the sentences shorter and better because you can avoid repetition.

```{raw} html
<div>In <strong><em>affirmative sentences</strong></em>, use <strong>and</strong>:</div>
<div style="color:#0173bc"><span style="font-weight:bold">The tiger shark</span> <span style="text-decoration:underline">has</span> sharp teeth. <span style="font-weight:bold">The tiger shark</span> <span style="text-decoration:underline">has</span> a powerful bite.</div>
<div style="color:#0173bc">-> The tiger shark has sharp teeth <b>and</b> a powerful bite.</div>
<div>In <strong><em>negative sentences</em></strong>, use <strong>or</strong>:</div>
<div style="color:#0173bc"><span style="font-weight:bold">The whale shark</span> <span style="text-decoration:underline">does not</span> have sharp teeth. <span style="font-weight:bold">The whale shark</span> <span style="text-decoration:underline">does not</span> have a powerful bite.</div>
