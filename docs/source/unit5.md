## Health and fitness collocations

```{admonition} Collocations
:class: important

**Collocations are pairs of words that frequently occur together**, for example,
**noun + noun** or **adjective + noun**. Collocations sound correct to fluent speakers
of a language. For example, heart disease is a frequent collocation in English. It
sounds correct. On the other hand, heart illness sounds wrong, even though we
can understand the meaning.
