A Venn diagram is useful for taking notes on similarities and
differences. It consists of two or three overlapping circles. The
differences will listed on the left side and right side of the
diagram. The similarities are listed in the center.

British and American English

.. raw:: html

   </h2>

.. container::

   There are some similarities and some differences between American
   English and British English. English is a global language spoken and
   understood by millions of people around the world, and two of the
   most common variations of English are British English, spoken in the
   U.K., and American English, spoken in the U.S. The first similarity
   is that both American and British English share the same grammar.
   Both varieties of English have the same subject-verb agreement rules
   and sentence structure. Another similarity is the vocabulary. People
   can use many of the same basic words and phares in the U.S. or the
   U.K. and people will understand them. For example, if you ask someone
   “Where is the bus stop?” in either the U.K or the U.S., that person
   will be able to help you. However, there are also many differences
   between these two varieties of English. The first difference is the
   pronunciation. There are many words and sounds that are pronounced
   differently in British English and American English. For instance, in
   British English, people don’t usually pronounce the “r” sound, but it
   is pronounced strongly in American English (such as the word
   “water”). The second difference is the spelling. American English
   often drops the “u” in words that are spelled “colour” or “harbour”
   in British English. (The American spellings of these words are
   “color” and “harbor”). In conclusion, there are both similarities and
   differences in the varieties of the English that are used in the U.S.
   and the U.K.

Topic sentences

   <p style="margin-left:1em;">

A topic sentence is usually the first sentence in a paragraph. It
introduces the main idea of the paragraph and often the point that the
writer wants to make about the topic. A topic sentence should be a
general statement about the paragraph’s subject, but it shouldn’t be too
specific. It is then support by the order sentences in the paragraph.
